        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shoyu Ramen (醤油ラーメン), also known as Tokyo ramen, consists of a soy sauce flavor and a clear soup broth served with medium-thin curly noodles. The light but delicious soup stock is typically made from chicken bones and/or pork bones and occasionally kombu seaweed, dried anchovies, and katsuobushi (bonito flakes). Simple toppings of chashu Japanese pork belly, pickled bamboo shoots, green onions, and nori seaweed give Shoyu ramen its classic look.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork leg bones</li>
            <li>Pork belly strips</li>
            <li>Rendered chicken fat</li>
            <li>Aromatics: Onion, garlic, ginger, negi</li>
            <li>Shoyu tare</li>
            <li>Ramen noodles</li>
            <li>Ramen toppings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start making the soup broth by simmering the pork leg bones, aromatics, and pork belly in the water for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Right before the 2-hour mark, take out some of the soup broth and combine it with soy sauce, sake, mirin, and salt in another pot to make the chashu sauce.</li>
            <li>At the 2-hour mark, add the chicken fat and green parts of the long onions to the soup broth and cook for another hour.</li>
            <li>After a total of 3 hours of simmering the soup broth, take out the pork belly, and continue simmering the soup broth for the next 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pork belly to the chashu sauce and braise for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>After cooking for 2 hours, remove the chashu from the sauce and let cool completely before refrigerating (or freezing). Save this chashu sauce for the ramen's shoyu tare (sauce).</li>
            <li>After a total of 6 hours of simmering the soup broth, remove the bones and aromatics, and the soup broth is ready.</li>
            <li>To serve, cut the chilled chashu into thin slices and cook the ramen noodles. Add the shoyu tare, piping-hot soup broth, and ramen noodles to the bowl. Top with ramen toppings of your choice and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
